# ðŸ§© [Tassle](https://github.com/eserozvataf/tassle)

Tassle is a kit of .NET Standart components. Since .NET Core is introduced, everything in
.NET world now smaller and portable. While .NET developers are still adapting to the new
ecosystem, Tassle's convention and mindset will help you to understand how things will work
and be handled in brand new .NET and how new tools can be extended to provide new features.

This project is the product of many years of iterative development and combined community
knowledge. However you're free to use this components in the way that you want, you'll be
learning best practises underneath them.

Previous iteration of this project is named [tasslehoff-library](https://github.com/eserozvataf/tasslehoff-library) and deprecated with the release of .NET
Core.


## Quick start to use

You'll find the components at [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/) as soon as they released.
